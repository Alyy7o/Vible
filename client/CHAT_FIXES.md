# Chat System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve chat and messaging issues in the social media app.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Images Not Sending in Messages**
- **Problem**: Image uploads were failing due to incorrect field mapping and missing error handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed `media_type` vs `message_type` field mismatch
  - Added proper error handling for image uploads
  - Fixed FormData handling on both client and server
  - Added proper cleanup of temporary files

### 2. **Chat Not Persisting After Leaving**
- **Problem**: Messages were being reset when leaving the chat due to `resetMessages()` being called
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed automatic message reset on component unmount
  - Messages now persist in Redux state
  - Chat history is maintained when navigating between chats

### 3. **Message Display Issues**
- **Problem**: Messages weren't showing properly due to incorrect field references
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed message type field references (`media_type` instead of `message_type`)
  - Added proper message sorting by timestamp
  - Fixed user identification for message alignment
  - Added loading states and error handling

### 4. **Server-Side Message Controller Issues**
- **Problem**: Multiple bugs in the message controller causing failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed async/await usage in image upload
  - Added proper error handling and validation
  - Fixed message creation with correct field names
  - Added proper user data population

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Server-Side (messageController.js)
- Fixed `media_url` variable declaration (let instead of const)
- Added proper async/await for image upload
- Fixed field mapping (`media_type` instead of `message_type`)
- Added temporary file cleanup
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed message population and response structure

### Client-Side (ChatBox.jsx)
- Added loading states for better UX
- Fixed message display logic
- Added proper image preview with remove functionality
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Fixed message alignment based on sender
- Added message timestamps

### Redux State Management (messagesSlice.js)
- Added proper loading and error states
- Fixed message fetching and handling
- Added duplicate message prevention
- Improved error handling for async actions

### Routes (messageRoutes.js)
- Added recent messages endpoint (`/api/message/recent`)
- Fixed route handler imports

## 📱 User Experience Improvements

1. **Better Loading States**: Users see clear feedback during operations
2. **Image Preview**: Users can see selected images before sending
3. **Message Persistence**: Chat history is maintained when navigating
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when things go wrong
5. **Real-time Updates**: Messages appear immediately via SSE
6. **Responsive Design**: Better mobile experience

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Send Text Messages**: Type and send text messages
2. **Send Image Messages**: Select and send images
3. **Navigate Between Chats**: Leave and return to verify persistence
4. **Check Real-time Updates**: Send messages from different browsers/devices
5. **Verify Image Display**: Ensure images show properly in chat

## 🔍 Key Files Modified

- `server/controllers/messageController.js` - Fixed server-side logic
- `server/routes/messageRoutes.js` - Added recent messages route
- `client/src/pages/ChatBox.jsx` - Fixed chat interface
- `client/src/pages/Messages.jsx` - Improved messages list
- `client/src/features/messages/messagesSlice.js` - Fixed Redux state

## ✅ Expected Results

- Images now send successfully in messages
- Chat history persists when leaving and returning
- Messages display correctly with proper alignment
- Real-time updates work via Server-Sent Events
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Improved overall chat experience

The chat system should now work reliably with proper image support and message persistence.
